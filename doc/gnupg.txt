INTRODUCTION                                    *gnupg*

This script implements transparent editing of gpg encrypted files. The
filename must have a .gpg, .pgp or .asc suffix. When opening such a file the
content is decrypted, when opening a new file the script will ask for the
recipients of the encrypted file. The file content will be encrypted to all
recipients before it is written. The script turns off viminfo, swapfile, and
undofile to increase security.

COMMANDS                                        *gnupg-commands*

                                                *gnupg-:GPGEditRecipients*
:GPGEditRecipients      Opens a scratch buffer to change the list of
                        recipients. Recipients that are unknown (not in your
                        public key) are highlighted and have a prepended "!".
                        Closing the buffer makes the changes permanent.

                                                *gnupg-:GPGViewRecipients*
:GPGViewRecipients      Prints the list of recipients.

                                                *gnupg-:GPGEditOptions*
:GPGEditOptions         Opens a scratch buffer to change the options for
                        encryption (symmetric, asymmetric, signing). Closing
                        the buffer makes the changes permanent. WARNING: There
                        is no check of the entered options, so you need to
                        know what you are doing.

VARIABLES                                       *gnupg-variables*

                                                *gnupg-g:GPGExecutable*
g:GPGExecutable         If set used as gpg executable, otherwise the system
                        chooses what is run when "gpg" is called. Defaults to
                        "gpg".

                                                *gnupg-g:GPGUseAgent*
g:GPGUseAgent           If set to 0 a possible available gpg-agent won't be
                        used. Defaults to 1.

                                                *gnupg-g:GPGPreferSymmetric*
g:GPGPreferSymmetric    If set to 1 symmetric encryption is preferred for new
                        files. Defaults to 0.

                                                *gnupg-g:GPGPreferArmor*
g:GPGPreferArmor        If set to 1 armored data is preferred for new files.
                        Defaults to 0 unless a "*.asc" file is being edited.

                                                *gnupg-g:GPGPreferSign*
g:GPGPreferSign         If set to 1 signed data is preferred for new files.
                        Defaults to 0.

                                                *gnupg-g:GPGDefaultRecipients*
g:GPGDefaultRecipients  If set, these recipients are used as defaults when no
                        other recipient is defined. This variable is a Vim
                        list. Default is unset.

                                                *gnupg-g:GPGUsePipes*
g:GPGUsePipes           If set to 1, use pipes instead of temporary files when
                        interacting with gnupg. When set to 1, this can cause
                        terminal-based gpg agents to not display correctly
                        when prompting for passwords. Defaults to 0.

                                                *gnupg-g:GPGHomedir*
g:GPGHomedir            If set, specifies the directory that will be used for
                        GPG's homedir. This corresponds to gpg's --homedir
                        option. This variable is a Vim string.

                                                *gnupg-g:GPGFilePattern*
g:GPGFilePattern        If set, overrides the default set of file patterns
                        that determine whether this plugin will be activated.
                        Defaults to '*.\(gpg\|asc\|pgp\)'.
